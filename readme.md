### Workshop 3 – Express and jQuery
The aim of this workshop is to introduce you to using ‘express’ and creating a webserver
that will respond to requests. We will use a simple HTML page (form) on the front end to
communicate with our server. We will use a jQuery Ajax request to send a message from
the client to the server and await a response from that request and change the display of
the client based on the result.
In future weeks we will continue with the development of the express based server but
we will changeup the tool for creating the client side to Angular so that we can create
dynamic web apps.
